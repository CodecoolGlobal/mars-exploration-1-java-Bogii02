To run this app:
- Pull the repo
- Start the project by starting the Application file.
- The terrain element name is either "mountain" or "pit"
- You can add as many as You want as many times as You want
- The more You add the bigger the amp is gonna be
- The other terrain types are the pairs of these two, They are placed randomly, next to their pairs (mountain-mineral, pit-water)
- When You are done enter "q"
- You can see in the terminal how the chosen terrain types and their pairs are placed
- There was another file, that allowed us to display the map in a game-like-map format outside of the terminal, unfortunately however, that file can not be public... .
